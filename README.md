# Library of UI components

Small library of various UI components that we are, or were, using at Brainly.
All components have no external dependencies, use bare-bones web platform, are written in ES6 and, most importantly, have great performance. Note that we do not support anything older than IE11.

For demos, see the [project page](https://brainly.github.io/ui-components).

Available components:

- [Simple flip clock](components/simple-flip-clock/README.md)
- [Flip card](components/flip-card/README.md)
- [Doughnut Progress Bar](components/doughnut-progress-bar/README.md)
- [Dashed Progress Bar](components/dashed-progress-bar/README.md)
- [Card Deck](components/card-deck/README.md)
